## Install from MODX Extras

Search for emo in the Package Manager of your MODX installation and install it
in there.

## Manual installation

If you can't access the MODX Extras Repository in your MODX installation, you
can manually install emo.

* Download the transport package from [MODX Extras](https://modx.com/extras/package/emo) (or one of the pre-built transport packages in [_packages](https://github.com/Jako/emo/tree/master/_packages))
* Upload the zip file to your MODX installation's `core/packages` folder or upload it manually in the MODX Package Manager.
* In the MODX Manager, navigate to the Package Manager page, and select 'Search locally for packages' from the dropdown button.
* emo should now show up in the list of available packages. Click the corresponding 'Install' button and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

## Build it from source

To build and install the package from source you could use [Git Package
Management](https://github.com/TheBoxer/Git-Package-Management). The GitHub
repository of emo contains a
[config.json](https://github.com/Jako/emo/blob/master/_build/config.json)
to build that package locally. Use this option, if you want to debug emo
and/or contribute bugfixes and enhancements.
